Questions:
How much variation(in the PSI) exist in the coils?  
What is the source of this variation?

The whole set data shows that there are one or more outliers in 
the data as the interquartile range is small(IQR = 1) with 
Q3 + 1.5IQR < Max and Q1 - 1.5IQR > Min.


Assuming that the errors in the production for coils are random
in nature, a normal distribution is used to model the expected
variation from expected/intended value.
In order to answer what the source of the variation in the data,
I grouped the data by Lots and computed the mean and standard
deviation for each Lot.  Each Lot has mean value very close to
1500 PSI (the likely production target for the coils), however
the lots have an increasing standard deviation. Telling us that
controlling the error in the coils manufactured is the worst in
Lot 3.

Lot1
mean = 1500.018
stdev = 1.070525

Lot2
mean = 1499.571
stdev = 3.183003

Lot3
mean = 1499.004
stdev = 14.832753

If we let x = Lot1 and y = Lot 2  and compare them with a t-test
we get a small confidence interval, meaning we have a confidence
that the means of the two populations are similar:

Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  x$PSI and y$PSI
t = 0.94185, df = 59.945, p-value = 0.35
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.5026969  1.3973088
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y 
 1500.018  1499.571 

However, if we compare x = Lot1 and z = Lot3, we get a much larger
confidence interval, meaning the there is a strong likelihood that
to two means will vary quite a bit as the sample size increases.
